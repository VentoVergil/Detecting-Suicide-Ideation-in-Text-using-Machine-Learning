# Detecting Suicide Ideation in Text using Machine Learning
This project investigates the use of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to automatically detect suicide ideation in text data.

# Problem Statement
The alarming rise in suicide rates necessitates the development of tools for early intervention and prevention. This project aims to create a model that can effectively classify text snippets into categories of "suicide" and "non-suicide" to aid in identifying individuals at risk.

# Data
The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle: http://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhileswarkomati/suicide-watch/code

# Code Structure
The project code is organized into the following stages:

  - Load Data: Load the suicide ideation dataset from Kaggle.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the text data to understand its characteristics and distribution of sentiment.
  - Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the text data for machine learning modeling. This may involve tasks like removing punctuation, stop words, and stemming/lemmatization.
  - Modeling: Implement and compare different machine learning models for text classification, including:
    -   Traditional models like TF-IDF Vectorizer and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
    -   Deep learning models like Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) using Keras.
  
# Approach
This project takes a comparative approach, evaluating the performance of both traditional and deep learning models for suicide ideation detection. The aim is to identify the model that achieves the highest classification accuracy.

# Libraries
The project utilizes the following Python libraries:

  - NLTK: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing tasks.
  - Wordcloud: Creates visualizations of word frequencies.
  - seaborn: Provides data visualization tools.
  - pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
  - keras: Deep learning library for building and training neural networks.
  
# Results
The project aims to achieve a classification accuracy of over 90% on the test dataset. This would indicate a highly effective model for detecting suicide ideation in text data.

# Future Work
Future work includes exploring BERT sentence embeddings for improved accuracy, transfer learning for model optimization, and multimodal approaches combining text with user behavior data.
